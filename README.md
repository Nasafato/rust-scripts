# rust-scripts

I am back to playing around with Rust again, and I thought I'd combine it with my renewed interest in increasing my fluency with the Unix command line.

I'd like to thank [Casey](https://github.com/casey) from my days back at Recurse Center â€” his tireless help working through Rust and [his advice](https://rodarmor.com/blog/unix-utilities-in-rust-for-great-success/) to newbies on how to dive into doing interesting stuff with the language were what finally made me code something more than Hello World in Rust. 

I can't find the code for the file syncer I had been attempting near the end of RC, but the first two crappy programs I'm going to throw in here once I get the chance.

## The scripts
So far, we have [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/). I'd like to do a few more, maybe write an argument parser before I just use [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.0/clap/), but I have no ambitious goals. Fulfillment of my intellectual curiosity is all I am concerned with.
